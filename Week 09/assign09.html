    <h2>What is Parsing?</h2>
    <div class="outputBox">
        <p>Simply put, parsing is the method used to convert one string of data into a different type of data.
            Fundamentally, it is significant because different programs/entities need data to be in different formats.
            Parsing enable this to happan and the data to be comphrendable to its respective programs.
            <br><br><b>BELOW ARE EXAMPLES TO SHOW YOU THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PARSING AND NOT PARSING DATA</b></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Part 1: JS AJAX -->
    <h3>Example: Not Parsing</h3>
    <form>
        <label for="cities">Please Select a Country</label>
        <select id="cities" onchange="getCountry(this.value)">
            <option value="">Select a country</option>
            <option value="russia.txt">Russia</option>
            <option value="mexico.txt">Mexico</option>
            <option value="canada.txt">Canada</option>
            <option value="usa.txt">USA</option>
        </select>
    </form>

    <div class="outputBox">
        <p id="country">Data will display here</p>
    </div>
    <hr>

    <!-- Part 2: JS JSON w/ AJAX-->
    <h3>Example: Parsing</h3>
    <form>
        <label for="url">Please Enter the Filename:</label>
        <input type="text" id="url" value="json.txt">
        <button type="button" onclick="loadFilename()">Search File</button>
    </form>

    <div class="outputBox">
        <table id="students"></table>
    </div>

    <!-- Sumamry Section-->
    <h3>Lesson Learned</h3>
    <div class="outputBox">
        <p>Notice the formatting and output of the two examples above. You will notice that one
            is a little wonky looking, while the other formatted neatly. The first example had .txt
            files that were not formatted in a way that allowed for effective parsing. It could be parsed,
            but would be diffcult and take time. The second example had .txt files formatted in a way that
            kept parsing in mind, thus parsing it was relatively easy. Overall, parsing is extremely useful
            and should be considered when sending or recieveing data from a server.</p>
